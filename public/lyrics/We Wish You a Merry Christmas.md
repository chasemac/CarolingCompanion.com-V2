We wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas,
And a Happy New Year.

**Chorus:**  
Good tidings we bring to you and your kin;
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Oh, bring us some figgy pudding,
Oh, bring us some figgy pudding,
Oh, bring us some figgy pudding,
And bring it right here.

*Chorus*

For we all like our figgy pudding,
We all like our figgy pudding,
We all like our figgy pudding,
With all its good cheer.

*Chorus*

We won't go until we get some,
We won't go until we get some,
We won't go until we get some,
So bring it right here.

*Chorus*

Now bring us some figgy pudding,
Now bring us some figgy pudding,
Now bring us some figgy pudding,
And bring some out here.

*Chorus*

And we wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas,
We wish you a Merry Christmas,
And a Happy New Year.

*Chorus*
