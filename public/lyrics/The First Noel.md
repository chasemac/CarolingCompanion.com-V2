The first Noel, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

**Chorus:**  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the East, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

*Chorus*

And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

*Chorus*

This star drew nigh to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

*Chorus*

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

*Chorus*

Then let us all with one accord,
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind hath bought.

*Chorus*
