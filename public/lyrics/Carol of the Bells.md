Hark how the bells,
Sweet silver bells,
All seem to say,
Throw cares away
Christmas is here,
Bringing good cheer,
To young and old,
Meek and the bold.

Ding dong ding dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling.
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From ev'rywhere
Filling the air.

Oh how they pound,
Raising the sound,
O'er hill and dale,
Telling their tale.
Gaily we sing,
We carol, o'er hill and dale.

Hear how the bells,
Silver bells,
Making a sound
So very profound.
All seem to say,
Christmas is here,
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas,
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas,
On on they send,
On without end,
Their joyful tone
To ev'ry home,
Hark how the bells,
Joyful, all seem to say,
Christmas is here,
Bringing good cheer,
Come carolers now
Merry Christmas all, 
Merry Christmas all, 
Merry Christmas all.

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas,
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas,
On on they send,
On without end,
Their joyful tone
To ev'ry home,
Ding dong ding dong, ding dong ding dong
