God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay,
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray.

**Chorus:**  
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

In Bethlehem, in Israel, this blessed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger upon this blessed morn;
The which His Mother Mary did nothing take in scorn.

*Chorus*

From God our Heavenly Father, a blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by Name.

*Chorus*

"Fear not," then said the angel, "let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Savior of pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him from Satan's power and might."

*Chorus*

Now to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface.

*Chorus*

The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm, and wind,
And went to Bethlehem straightway, this blessed Babe to find.

*Chorus*

But when to Bethlehem they came, whereat this Infant lay,
They found Him in a manger, where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling, unto the Lord did pray.

*Chorus*

Now all you Christians, hearken, and with great joy now sing:
Learn of the angels' lesson, this news which now we bring;
Christ born of humble Mary, our heavenly King.

*Chorus*
